title: "Private Repositories and Fixing Embargoed CVEs"
description: An overview of the workflows surrounding embargoed CVEs and private repository forks.
---

OpenShift CI supports setting up CI jobs for private repositories; originally to allow temporary non-public development on
the forks of the otherwise public repositories. The CI jobs executed for these forks are not shown in the public Deck
instance, and all their artifacts are not public. Access to these jobs is limited to engineers who need it.

The ability to use the CI with private repositories has been extended to work in a more general case.
There are two distinct ways to surface jobs for the repo within a `deck` instance.
1. Utilizing `qe-private-deck`; in order to do this, permission must be granted by Test Platform, and a QE representative.
At that time, a Test Platform member will assist with creating the proper configs.
2. When not configured to use a private `deck` instance, the logs and artifacts executed for the private repository
will be publicly available on the `deck`. **Only set up such jobs when you are absolutely sure your jobs would not leak any sensitive information.**

To allow the CI jobs to access a private repo, drop the following file to the directory in `openshift/release` holding the
`ci-operator` configuration for your repository (usually `ci-operator/config/$org/$repo`):

`.config.prowgen`
{{< highlight yaml >}}
private: true # allows the source to be cloned from the private repo, without setting this: jobs will not succeed
expose: true # allows the jobs to be displayed on the `deck` instance in which they are configured
{{< / highlight >}}

## `openshift-priv` organization

The `openshift-priv` organization holds private forks of selected repositories. The purpose of these forks is to allow
temporary non-public development. Their presence, content, settings, and all CI configuration are managed automatically.

*Automated tools manage all CI configuration for repositories in openshift-priv organization. Humans should not change
any CI configuration related to these repositories. All manual changes to this configuration will be overwritten.*

### Involved Repositories

The set of repositories that are managed automatically in `openshift-priv` is dynamic and consists of the following two subsets:

1. Repositories with existing CI configuration promoting `images` to the `ocp/4.X` namespace (same criteria like for
   enrollment into the centralized release branch management)
1. Repositories explicitly listed in the
   [allowlist](https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/core-services/openshift-priv/_whitelist.yaml)

### Automation Architecture

When a repository is identified to be included in `openshift-priv` by having the appropriate promoting configuration or by
being present in the allowlist, the following jobs and tools maintain the existence, repository settings, repository
content, and all necessary CI configuration of the fork in `openshift-priv`:

1. The
   [periodic-auto-private-org-peribolos-sync](https://deck-internal-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/?job=periodic-auto-private-org-peribolos-sync)
   job runs the
   [private-org-peribolos-sync](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/tree/master/cmd/private-org-peribolos-sync) tool to
   maintain the GitHub settings for the fork. These settings are asynchronously consumed by the
   [periodic-org-sync](https://prow.ci.openshift.org/?job=periodic-org-sync) job running the
   [peribolos](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/tree/main/cmd/peribolos) tool to create the fork on GitHub
   and maintain its settings
1. The
   [periodic-openshift-release-private-org-sync](https://deck-internal-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/?job=periodic-openshift-release-private-org-sync)
   job runs the [private-org-sync](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/tree/master/cmd/private-org-sync) tool to
   synchronize the `git` content of the fork with the source repository.
1. The [periodic-prow-auto-config-brancher](https://prow.ci.openshift.org/?job=periodic-prow-auto-config-brancher) runs
   the [`ci-operator-config-mirror`](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/tree/master/cmd/ci-operator-config-mirror) tool
   to create and maintain the CI configuration for the fork (`ci-operator` configuration files). The same job then generates
   the CI jobs from the `ci-operator` files. This has a caveat of not carrying over handcrafted (non-generated) jobs and also
   manual changes to the generated jobs.
1. The [periodic-prow-auto-config-brancher](https://prow.ci.openshift.org/?job=periodic-prow-auto-config-brancher) also
   runs the
   [private-prow-configs-mirror](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/tree/master/cmd/private-prow-configs-mirror) tool to
   mirror the repository-specific Prow configuration, like merging criteria, plugin enablement, etc.
